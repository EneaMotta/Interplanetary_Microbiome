    "For classification we decided to use the kraken2 Moshpit tool and used the combined dereplicated mags with pluspfp16 Kraken2 db.

The rationale behind this choice is the attempt to classify the dereplicated mags that were extracted in step 03 from all 3 domains of life. A size-capped database was used due to limits in computational usage (16Gb).\n",
